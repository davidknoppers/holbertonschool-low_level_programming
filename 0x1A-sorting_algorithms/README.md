# Holberton School - Sorting algorithms & Big O

A wide selection of major sorting algorithms in C.
Details are included about time and space complexity.

#Bubble Sort
O(n^2) time complexity
Best: O(n), average: O(n^2), worst: O(n^2)
In-place sort - no extra space needed, O(n) space complexity
Stable

#Insertion Sort
O(n^2) time complexity
Best: O(n), average: O(n^2), worst: O(n^2)
In-place sort - no extra space needed, O(n) space complexity
Stable
